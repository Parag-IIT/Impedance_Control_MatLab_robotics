# Impedance_Control_MatLab_Robotics
 Impedance control for a planar two-link robot involves regulating the dynamic interaction between the robot and its environment by controlling the relationship between force and motion. This is useful in tasks like contact manipulation, teleoperation, and human-robot interaction.
